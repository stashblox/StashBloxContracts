### supportsInterface `returns bool` `external`



Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
_interfaceID  | bytes4 |  The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165


### balanceOf `returns uint256` `public`

Get the specified address' balance for token with specified ID.
Attempting to query the zero account for a balance will result in a revert.


Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
account  | address | The address of the token holder
id  | uint256 | ID of the token


### balanceOfBatch `returns uint256[]` `public`

Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs.
If any of the query accounts is the zero account, this query will revert.


Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
accounts  | address[] | The addresses of the token holders
ids  | uint256[] | IDs of the tokens


### setApprovalForAll  `external`

Sets or unsets the approval of a given operator.
An operator is allowed to transfer all tokens of the sender on their behalf.
Because an account already has operator privileges for itself, this function will revert
if the account attempts to set the approval status for itself.


Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
operator  | address | address to set the approval
approved  | bool | representing the status of the approval to be set

### isApprovedForAll `returns bool` `public`



Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
account  | address |   The account of the Tokens
operator  | address |  Address of authorized operator


### safeTransferFrom  `external`

Transfers `value` amount of an `id` from the `from` address to the `to` address specified.
Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `from` account.
If `to` is a smart contract, will call `onERC1155Received` on `to` and act appropriately.


Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
from  | address | Source address
to  | address | Target address
id  | uint256 | ID of the token type
value  | uint256 | Transfer amount
data  | bytes | Data forwarded to `onERC1155Received` if `to` is a contract receiver

### safeBatchTransferFrom  `external`

Transfers `values` amount(s) of `ids` from the `from` address to the
`to` address specified. Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being
transferred out of the `from` account. If `to` is a smart contract, will
call `onERC1155BatchReceived` on `to` and act appropriately.


Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
from  | address | Source address
to  | address | Target address
ids  | uint256[] | IDs of each token type
values  | uint256[] | Transfer amounts per token type
data  | bytes | Data forwarded to `onERC1155Received` if `to` is a contract receiver

### _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck  `internal`



Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
operator  | address | from  | address | to  | address | id  | uint256 | value  | uint256 | data  | bytes | 

### _doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck  `internal`



Name  | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
operator  | address | from  | address | to  | address | ids  | uint256[] | values  | uint256[] | data  | bytes |
